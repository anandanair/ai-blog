## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-blog.git
    cd ai-blog
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (if `.env.example` exists, otherwise create `.env.local` manually).
    - Fill in all required environment variables. (See Environment Variables section below - add this section to your readme)

4.  **Run development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

5.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Content Generation

The platform leverages Google's Gemini AI for automated content generation. The process typically involves:

1.  **Topic Selection:** The system can be guided or can autonomously identify relevant tech topics based on current trends, existing content gaps, or predefined strategies.
2.  **Research & Grounding:** AI gathers information from various sources, which can be configured to include specific trusted websites or internal knowledge bases to ensure accuracy and relevance.
3.  **Content Creation:** Gemini AI drafts the blog post, focusing on creating engaging, informative, and accessible technical content. This includes structuring the article, writing paragraphs, and explaining complex concepts clearly.
4.  **Refinement & SEO:** The generated content can be reviewed and refined. The system also assists in generating SEO-friendly metadata, such as titles, descriptions, and keywords, as well as prompts for generating relevant images.

The core logic for content generation can be found in the `generators/` directory, particularly in files like `generate-post.ts`.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file defines several scripts for managing the project:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server, typically on `localhost:3000`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production. This process also triggers the generation of the RSS feed.
- `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server after a build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats code using Prettier.
- `npm run generate-sitemap`: Generates the `sitemap.xml` file.
- `npm run generate-rss`: Generates the `rss.xml` file.
- `npm run generate-post`: (If you have a specific script for this, otherwise this is a conceptual step handled by backend logic or manual triggering of generator scripts).
